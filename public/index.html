<p>This is a proof-of-concept. If you would like to test it, here is the ask.

Using a mirror, take a picture of your phone and sms it to <script>document.writeln('64' + '<!-- abcedfg -->' + '6-23' + '<!-- no bots -->' + '3-4264');</script>. Try and capture just the phone -- so a computer can recognize the image. Remember to turn off the flash.
