					<div class="section_white--column_right">Current Area of Interest : 
						I am interested in user generated content and intellectual property rights.
						<p>On today's UGC platforms, users are credited for comments, 
						photos, product reviews, etc. Corporations are the ones who profit from user contributions, 
						indefinitely, providing almost zero compensation to their users. 
						And corporations aren't on the hook for governance and free speech.
						Social networks go so far to beg/ask/incentivize users to monitor their platforms for fraud
						by flagging content and bots.
						<P>This benevolent kind of self-contained system 
							worked in the good old days. Today things are different. 
							There's a plague of bad actors, and things are getting worse fast with
							 generative AI and bots.
						</P>
						 <P>Would the network effect be achievable without destruction of IP rights in a liberated system?
						</P>
						<p>
						 Would social networks differ if users had full and perpetual rights to 
						 control their own data? Today's tangled process is one where companies 
						 must comply with laws to grant users the right to be forgotten. Both sides must 
						 jump through legal and technical challenges to achieve this, generally lacking 
						 fine-grained embedded controls, in order to comply with the laws as they are written.
						</p>
						<P>
						 Fast Forward. In 2026, it seems like it should be possible for users to manage their own data
						  through technology. Technology that can provide both
						  portability and dual-sided accountability when it comes to UGC and PII.
						</P>
						<P>
						 I've been trying to understand if businesses and individuals can both be 
						 assured that submitted data 
						 is real without having to expend capital on fraud detection. 
						 </P>
						 <p>
							New technology could make it easier 
						 	and cheaper to distinguish real people from bots and fake accounts.
							 <br/><br/>
						 For now, I am calling it "Anonymous Verified Users". By leveraging aspects of 
						 the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.1/">DID spec</a>, 
						 a blockchain ledger, zero knowledge proofs, and other technology to 
						 1. reduce the cost of fraud detection, 
						 2. provide fine-grain control over UGC, and 
						 3. allow corporations to analyze user data without exposing user data. 
						</P>
						<P>Anonymous Verified Users
							<ol>We should be able to
							<li>Share data</li>
							<li>Define how long we want to grant data access</li>
							<li>Retain ownership of our data</li>
							<li>Sign our data, in a way that is anonymous and unforgeable</li>
							</ol>
						<P>AVU data consumers are entites with rights too.
							<ol>They can
								<li>Have proof that data is REAL, not a bot, nor a forgery</li>
								<li>Perform computations on the data, without seeing the raw data</li>
							</ol>

						</P>	
						Currently, this system sounds and looks good, but one problem is that anyone with
			            access to the data can copy the data in place to de-associate the owner from their data.
						The only defence is that if a bad actor copies data, they lose the provenance. 
						But Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and ZKP can lock down the gap.
						</P>

        Some projects that I am proud of:
        Upkept
        Broadbandtogether
        Nationbuilder
        Crowdsignal


				<!-- broadbandtogether: I worked on a company initiative to fix broadband. 
				We embarked on a campaign to collect real invoices from users, and captured over 50,000.
				as well as real data on user's broadband speed together with the-x-lab at Penn State University.
				We discovered a disconnect between what people thought they signed up for and what they were paying.
				From my point of view, one of the major accomplishments of this campaign was transparency in pricing by 
				requiring providers to display a "Broadband Facts Label"
				to gather data on US broadband costs, quality, and speeds by having consumers upload bills, aiming to advocate for better, fairer, and affordable internet access for all by revealing industry practices
				highlighting the need for universal, affordable high-speed internet for work, school, and healthcare
				A crowdsourcing project asking people to share their internet bills and speed test results. 
				To get real data on costs and speeds, bypassing limited government info.
