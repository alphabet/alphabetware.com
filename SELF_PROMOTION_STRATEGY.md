**Low-Touch Posting Schedule:**
- **Post once per week** - Quality over quantity
- Repurpose blog posts (snippet + link to full article)
- Share project demos with technical write-up
- **No need to engage/comment** - Let your content speak for itself

**Passive Engagement Strategy:**
- Turn on "Open to Work" (visible to recruiters only)

### Warm Introductions (Email Only)
- **Email** former colleagues: "I'm exploring opportunities in X space, who do you know at..."
- Ask for **email intros**, not calls: "Would you be comfortable making an email introduction?"
- Use your non-profit network: board members, partners, advisors often have tech connections
- **Maximum 1-2 actual calls per month** - save these for final interviews or exceptional opportunities

```
Subject: Re: [Their Blog Post Title] - privacy architecture approach

Hi [Name],

Really enjoyed your post on [specific technical topic]. The section about [specific challenge] resonated - I recently architected a similar system for [anonymized description of non-profit work].

I built a proof-of-concept for anonymous user verification using WebAuthn + blockchain that might interest you: [link to AVU demo]. It addresses [specific pain point they mentioned] without [downside they mentioned].

I also wrote up the technical approach here: [link to blog post with architecture details]

After 10+ years leading architecture at [non-profit], I'm exploring senior technical roles where I can work on [their company's domain] problems at scale. Happy to share more via email if there's a potential fit.

Best,
Gui

Portfolio: [your website]
GitHub: [your profile]

P.S. - Also did some work on [other relevant project] if [other pain point] is on your radar: [link]
```

**Key changes:**
- Removed call ask
- Provide all context via links
- Let them reach out if interested
- Give multiple ways to explore your work asynchronously

## 11. INTROVERT SUPERPOWERS (Use These to Your Advantage)

### Why This Actually Works Better for You

**Introverts excel at:**
- **Deep, thoughtful writing** - Your blog posts will be more thorough than most
- **Detailed technical documentation** - Your READMEs will stand out
- **Asynchronous communication** - Email lets you craft perfect responses
- **Building things that speak for themselves** - Demos > networking events
- **Quality over quantity** - 1 perfect email > 20 rushed coffee chats

**The companies you want** value:
- Engineers who can write clear technical docs
- Architects who think deeply before speaking
- People who build instead of just talking
- Async-first communication (remote-friendly companies)

### Async-First Job Search Strategy

**Your advantage:** Senior roles care about **what you've built**, not how social you are.

**Proof points that work without talking:**
1. **GitHub portfolio** - Code quality speaks volumes
2. **Technical blog** - Demonstrates thinking and communication
3. **Working demos** - AVU wallet shows you ship
4. **Documentation** - Shows you can scale yourself via writing

**Interview strategy:**
- Most interviews are **required** to be async-first (take-home projects, written exercises)
- For final rounds: "I do my best thinking in writing - can I provide written responses?"
- Companies hiring remote talent understand async communication
- Your detailed emails will impress more than 50 networking calls

### Setting Boundaries (This is OK)

**In your LinkedIn bio:**
> "I prefer asynchronous communication and do my best work in writing. Portfolio and detailed case studies below."

**Email signature:**
> "I communicate best via email and detailed write-ups. Happy to hop on a call for final discussions, but I find async collaboration more effective for technical conversations."

**Auto-responder for LinkedIn DMs:**
> "Thanks for reaching out! I prefer email communication where I can share detailed thoughts. You can reach me at [email] - looking forward to connecting there."

### Companies That Will Love This About You

**Target remote-first companies** that already operate async:
- GitLab (async-first culture)
- Automattic (WordPress) - famous for async work
- Basecamp/37signals - minimal meetings philosophy
- Doist (Todoist) - remote, async
- Many privacy/security companies (engineers who prefer deep work)

**Avoid:**
- High-meeting cultures
- "We're a family" (code for lots of forced socializing)
- Companies requiring daily standups, constant Slack, etc.

**Look for in job descriptions:**
- "Remote-first"
- "Async communication"
- "Written documentation culture"
- "Deep work time"
- "Minimal meetings"

---

## FINAL THOUGHTS

**Your competitive advantages:**
- Deep technical expertise in hot areas (privacy, CV, AI)
- Proven leadership in resource-constrained environment
- Portfolio of working demos, not just resume bullets
- Versatile: can architect, code, lead, communicate

**Biggest risk:**
- Being pigeonholed as "non-profit engineer" - combat with demos, blog posts showing cutting-edge work
- Analysis paralysis - start with quick wins above

**Success looks like:**
- 3+ companies reaching out to YOU because of content
- Conversations starting with "I read your post on..." not "Tell me about yourself"
- Offers from companies doing meaningful work on hard problems
- Role where your architecture decisions drive product success

**Start today. Ship the first blog post this week. The rest will follow.**
