						I am interested in privacy and intellectual property rights as they pertain to user generated content (UGC).
						<p>While users are "credited" for comments, 
						photos, product reviews, etc., corporations are the ones who profit from user contributions, 
						indefinitely. The only compensation is targetted ads and social media affirmation.
						Social networks beg/ask/incentivize users to monitor their platforms for fraud
						by flagging content and bots.
						<P>This kind of benevolent self-contained system 
							worked in the good old days but today things are different,
							 getting worse fast with generative AI and bots.
						</P>
						 <!-- P>Would the network effect be achievable without destruction of IP rights in a liberated system?
						</P -->
						<!-- p>
						 Would social networks differ if users had full and perpetual rights to 
						 control their own data? Today's tangled process is one where companies 
						 must comply with laws to grant users the right to be forgotten. Both sides must 
						 jump through legal and technical challenges to achieve this, generally lacking 
						 fine-grained embedded controls, in order to comply with the laws as they are written.
						</p -->
						<P>
						 In 2026, it seems like it should be possible for users to manage their own data
						  through technology. 
						 Business owners would benefit from this as well. 
						</P>
						<P>
						A system where businesses and individuals can both be 
						 assured that submitted data 
						 is real without having to expend capital on fraud detection. 
						 and real people from bots and fake accounts easily and cheaply.
							 <br/><br/>
						 For now, I am calling it "Anonymous Verified Users". 

						 
						 <br/><br/>It leverages Self Soverign Identity (SSI)
						 with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.1/">DID spec</a>, 
						 blockchain ledger, zero knowledge proofs, and any other 
             proof of personhood technology as needed.
						<br/><br/>
						The benefits are:
						 <br/>1. reduce the cost of fraud detection 
						 <br/>2. fine-grain control over UGC
						 <br/>3. ability to analyze user data without exposing it 
						</P>
						<P>Users/consumers
							<ol>Can
							<li>Share data</li>
							<li>Define how long we want to share our data</li>
							<li>Sign our data, in a way that is anonymous and unforgeable</li>
							<li>Retain ownership of our data</li>
							</ol>
						<P>System implimenters
							<ol>Can
								<li>Have proof that data is REAL, not a bot, nor a forgery</li>
								<li>Perform computations on the data, without seeing the raw data</li>
							</ol>

						</P>	
            <P>
            One problem that must be addressed is how to stop anyone with
			      access to the data from coping the data in place.
            <br/>
            The current state of the art is such that if a bad actor copies the data in place,
            the owner is disociated from their data and the thief loses the provenance.
						But Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and ZKP can lock down the gap.

				<!-- broadbandtogether: I worked on a company initiative to fix broadband. 
				We embarked on a campaign to collect real invoices from users, and captured over 50,000.
				as well as real data on user's broadband speed together with the-x-lab at Penn State University.
				We discovered a disconnect between what people thought they signed up for and what they were paying.
				From my point of view, one of the major accomplishments of this campaign was transparency in pricing by 
				requiring providers to display a "Broadband Facts Label"
				to gather data on US broadband costs, quality, and speeds by having consumers upload bills, aiming to advocate for better, fairer, and affordable internet access for all by revealing industry practices
				highlighting the need for universal, affordable high-speed internet for work, school, and healthcare
				A crowdsourcing project asking people to share their internet bills and speed test results. 
				To get real data on costs and speeds, bypassing limited government info.
